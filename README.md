### Exercise One

The goal is to look for the Mobile Vision dependency that needs to be
added to our `build.gradle` file.

#### Add Mobile Vision Library dependency
Visit the Firebase MLKit developer [website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/android/detect-faces)
and look for the setup of the vision library.

### Lastly do not forget to test on your phone.
After adding the library on your `build.gradle` file make sure you are
able to `Rebuild` your project on Andorid Studio. Finally, test your
project on your phone.
