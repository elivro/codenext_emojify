### Computer Vision Pipeline

A computer vision [pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64hFcqhnNow&feature=emb_logo)
defines a series of steps that most computer vision applications will go
through. In general it starts off by acquiring images and meta data (labels),
then processing that meta data, performing some analysis and recognition
of patterns steps, then finally performing an action.

### How to train a Neural Network?
We typically [train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=m4GVfwVkj74&feature=emb_logo)
a model by providing sets of labelled images, which
we can compare to the predicted output label. The neural network then
monitors any errors it makes (by comparing the correct label to the output
label) and corrects for them by modifying how it finds and prioritizes
patterns and differences among the image data. Eventually, given enough
labelled data, the model should be able to characterize any new,
unlabeled, image data it sees!

### Convolutional neural networks
[Convolutional neural networks](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)
are a specific type of neural network that are commonly used in computer
vision applications. They learn to recognize patterns among a given set
of images.
